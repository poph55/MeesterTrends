## Leighton Meester
Leighton Meester was born in 1986 to parents Connie and Doug in jail. Meester's mother gave birth just a few months into her 10 year drug-smuggling prison sentence. She wound up only serving 16 months and was released the same year as Meester's birth. The actress has a wonderful relationship with her mother and cites the circumstance of her birth as one of the reasons she is currently so open-minded. Meester starred in the hit CW show Gossip Girl as Blair Waldorf between 2007-2012. 

## Background
I created a program to help people figure out whether or not things are more popular than Leighton Meester (or Britney Spears) since 2004 using google trends data. The code accesses google trends data through pytrends and puts the data for the input, Leighton Meester, and Britney Spears into a list. It then cumulatively sums the list to create an overall popularity index for each term. These sums are used to compare the terms together and create percent differential between the input and the static terms.
